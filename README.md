## Prerequisits üõ†Ô∏è
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (specifically [fzf-tmux](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#fzf-tmux-script))
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)


## Install üíª
Add this to your `.tmux.conf` and run `Ctrl-I` for TPM to install the plugin.
```conf
set -g @plugin 'omerxx/tmux-sessionx'
```

## Configure ‚öôÔ∏è
The default binding for this plugin is `<prefix>+O`
You can change it by adding this line with your desired key:
```bash
# I recommend using `o` if not already in use, for least key strokes when launching
set -g @sessionx-bind '<mykey>'
```
The line above will let you use `<prefix>+<mykey>` to launch
tmux-sessionx popup, in-case you want to bind only `<mykey>` without the tmux `<prefix>`
you will have to add an extra line to turn the prefix off.
```bash
set -g @sessionx-prefix off

```
`C-x` is customizeable as well, by default it indexes `$HOME/.config`, but this can be changed by adding this config line:
```bash
# e.g. set -g @sessionx-x-path '~/dotfiles'
set -g @sessionx-x-path '<some-path>'
```

## Working with SessionX üë∑
Launching the plugin pops up an fzf-tmux "popup" with fizzy search over existing session (-current session).
If you insert a non-existing name and hit enter, a new session with that name will be created.
- `C-r` will launch a `read` prompt to rename a session within the list
- `C-d` will delete the selected session
- `C-w` will reload the list with all the available *windows* and their preview
- `C-x` will fuzzy read `~/.config` or a configureable path of your choice (with `@session-x-path`)


## WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è
This was only tested on one, macOs machine.
It is also not designed to use outside Tmux and is tailored to fit *my* needs.
That said, please feel free to open issues with bugs / additions you'd like to see.
